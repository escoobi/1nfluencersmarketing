##Practical Test
* Create an application using Python, Flask and SQL to register and authenticate an user.
The user must have an unique email address and the password must have at least 8
characters.
* The application must consult an external API, such as PokeAPI(https://pokeapi.co/), use
Pandas to process the data and save it in a MongoDB database. The CRUD endpoints
for this part of the application must be accessible only to a previously authenticated user
existing in the SQL database. All endpoints must return an JSON response with status,
data, message and HTTP code.
* The project must be added to a public repository on Github and shared with the person
responsible for the selection. The README.md file must contain the answers for the
theoretical test, as well as the instructions necessary to execute the project.
The code must be well documented and follow good development practices.
